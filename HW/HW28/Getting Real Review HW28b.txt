# Read or skim this book: Getting Real Book http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php . It's really thought provoking and describes a way of thinking about building products which match what we have been doing in class. My goal with this homework is that you take an hour to absorb the key messages of the book and put it on your personal reading list.
# DELIVERABLE: Write a blog post reviewing the book for a technical audience. 



When I read the Zen of Programming, I loved it: very amusing, and very insightful. It reinforced many ideas I've found to be integral to programming in my limited experience. However, this summer, as I began to practice Agile Development, I found that the tenets taught in Zen of Programming were no longer applicable; programming as espoused by Zen of Programming was no longer relevant when developing with Agile Development methodologies. It's not that there is an inherent contradiction between the two philosophies; each is merely concerned with its own topic, namely, programming and development. Which is where Getting Real, by 37 Signals, comes in.  If you want to learn about Agile Development, start with Getting Real. 
	The book covers all the topics involved with creating and maintaining a product. The book starts by helping you define the idea for your product, funding it, and differentiating yourself from the competition; it continues through feature selection, staffing considerations, coding, and many more topics; it even covers pricing, promotion, and post-launch considerations. 	Each chapter is a collection of related essays; each essay covers its own topic and may be read independently. The essays are marked by practical advice, based on 37 Signal's own experiences of creating products; at the end of most essay are a few quotes, with hyperlinks, from other books that cover the topic. These hyperlinked quotes are Getting Real's biggest strength. Instead of being isolated, the book can serve as a portal to the rest of your journey to learning Agile. 
	The book is written in a style befitting of its message; it's sleek, without waste, and overall feels like a series of stories. I would liken the experience to sitting down to take an interview with a true master, but instead of just one or two hours you have enough time to ask all the right questions to extract all those little nuggets of sage advice that he has stored in his head from years of perfecting his art. Best of all though, if you pay close attention you'll leave with a fresh outlook on life.
