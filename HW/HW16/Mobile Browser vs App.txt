This is an interesting topic. Do you make a mobile application which is browser based or standalone? 

I guess the answer is a bit gray

Let's assume that an app developed for a specific system is supposed to be more powerful and able to take full advantage of that device.
On the other hand, developing for a browser will allow you to reach a larger audience, independent of their device.

What it really comes down to is, where will the revenue come from? It obviously takes more money to develop for more than one platform. From that p.o.v, the browser's a better option. If you don't need to take advantage of the phone's hardware,

... then it's probably not worth the saved money and time. to develop for one system. Ho

Need to look at the numbers...


I think the best approach is to always have a mobile browser site. If you project is better suited as an app, have a site with limited features. The site could be as simple as an advertisement for the app, but completely isolating yourself from customers whose mobiles can't run your app is not a good approach. 
On the other hand, there are cases when your program can execute all its functionality on a browser. Then, creating an app is probably not worth your time.
